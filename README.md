sns-durable-example
===

This example shows you how to durably subscribe to messages from an AWS [Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topic.

The example creates an SNS topic that is consumed and stored by an SQS queue.  This allows the subscriber to read the events from SNS
off of the SQS queue where they are durably stored.  The subscriber need not worry about message loss in the case of a disconnect 
because the SQS queue is storing the notifications.

##Running the Example
The example can be run using the following gradle command:

```
$ ./gradlew run
```
