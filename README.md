[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gregwhitaker/sns-durable-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gregwhitaker/sns-durable-example)

This example shows you how to durably subscribe to messages from an AWS [Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topic.

The example creates an SNS topic that is consumed and stored by an SQS queue.  This allows the subscriber to read the events from SNS
off of the SQS queue where they are durably stored.  The subscriber need not worry about message loss in the case of a disconnect 
because the SQS queue is storing the notifications.

##Prequisites
The example requires that you create an SNS topic and an SQS queue in your AWS account using the following CloudFormation template:

* [Example Setup CloudFormation](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/sns-durable-example/blob/master/src/main/cloudformation/sns-durable-example.json)

##Running the Example
The example can be run using the following gradle command:

```
$ ./gradlew run -DtopicArn={sns topic arn} -DqueueArn={sqs queue arn}
```

**NOTE:** The example is using the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProvider` so you can supply your AWS credentials using the `.aws/credentials` file, as system properties, or as environment variables.
